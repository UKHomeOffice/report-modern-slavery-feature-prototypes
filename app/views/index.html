      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Save and exit prototype</h2>

      <p>This page explains how to carry out user testing with this prototype. The prototype does not actually do Save and Return.  It attempts to fake the behaviour.
      </p>

      <p>As the user researcher, you'll need to use an email service such as your Home Office account to send a fake email to mirror the behaviour of the actual service.
      </p>

      <p>There are various scenarios of how save and retun will work.  Each scenario explains what the user will need to do and what the user researcher will do for testing.
      </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Scenario 1: The first application</h2>

      <p><a href="/landing">The report modern slavery landing page</a></p>

      <p>The user will be filling out the form for the first time to report modern slavery and will need to supply their work email and organisation as part of the login process, in order to obtain a link to start the application process for that report.</p>

      <p>The user researcher should take a note of the user's email and send a copy of an email to the user with the link below</p>

      <p><a href="/almost-there-scenario-1">Fill Out first application</a></p>

      <p>The user will go to their email and click on a link above.  It's best if the user is given a report of the victim of modern slavery so that the user enters predefined answers.  This will then get displayed later. The user will save and exit the application to be completed at a later date.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Scenario 2</h2>

      <p><a href="/existing-report-check-scenario-2">Returning to Existing application via website</a></p>

      <p>After an application has been saved, the user can return via the website to continue the application and change any answers they previously made. This will generate a new link that will be submitted to their email in order to continue the application</p>

      <p><a href="/almost-there-scenario-3">Returning to Existing application via email link</a></p>

      <p>Via the email link the user will be able to return to their existing application and change any answers they previously made.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Scenario 3</h2>

      <p><a href="/almost-there-scenario-4">Expired link (user has waited more than 30 minutes)</a></p>

      <p>Via the email link the user will attempt to return to their existing application. However due to the exiparation of the link they will need to enter their email to request a new valid link.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Scenario 4</h2>

      <p><a href="/almost-there-scenario-5">Application has been deleted after 28 days - user enters app via email link</a></p>

      <p>Via the email link the user will attempt to return to their existing application. However since the application is deleted  after 28 days they will be shown a message prompting them to start a new application.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Scenario 5</h2>

      <p><a href="/existing-report-check-scenario-6">Application has been deleted after 28 days - user enters app via website</a></p>

      <p>Via the webiste the user will attempt to return to their existing application by entering their email in order to receive a new link to continue.</p>

      <p><a href="/no-application-scenario-6">Application has been deleted after 28 days - user clicks on the email link that was sent</a></p>

      <p>However since the application is deleted after 28 days they will be shown a message prompting them to start a new application.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Scenario 6</h2>

      <p><a href="/cookie-not-found-scenario-6">Email link opens on a different device or browser so the cookie cannot be found</a></p>

      <p>If the link from the email is opened on a different device or browser, the cookie relating to the report will not be visible. At this stage they are assigned another cookie, asked to confirm their email and then sent another link relating to the new cookie</p>
